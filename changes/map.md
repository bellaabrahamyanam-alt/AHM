# Change log of the map domain

## 1. 2026-11-08: map highlights the selected place (task 004)

- **What:** `AHM.on('state:selected', ({ value }) => ...)` draws a ring (circle layer `ahm-highlight`, own GeoJSON source of the same name, one Point with `properties.id`) around the place with that id; `value` null removes it. The selected id is remembered, so the ring is redrawn after every `setFeatures`, when the map has loaded, and stays through base-map switches (`applyVis` skips `ahm-` layers). An id that is not among the features draws nothing and does not throw.
- **Why:** the sidebar publishes the selection in `AHM.state` (tasks 001, 003); the map shows it.
- **Files:** `app/js/map/map.js`, `changes/map.md`, `todo/map.md`. Tests: `tests/js/map.test.js` (written by map-tdd).
- **No interface change:** no new `AHM.map` command, no new event; the map reads no `AHM.state` and calls no sidebar code.
- **How to verify:** `node tests/js/run.js --no-browser`. By hand (real MapLibre is not in the tests): open the app, click a place in the sidebar (needs task 003): an orange ring appears around its marker; click another: the ring moves; deselect: it disappears; switch Map/Satellite or edit a layer (setFeatures): the ring stays.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

## 2. 2026-11-08: map markers: selected look, hover, tooltip, double click, clusters (task 008)

- **What:** the selected place has a white outline, a thin dark outer ring, a soft shadow and its own type symbol about 30% larger (layers `ahm-highlight*`, drawn last so they are above all labels and symbols); the orange ring is gone. Hover lifts a place symbol (icon-opacity 0.85), shows a pointer and a tooltip with name and type above the bullet (below it when there is no room); one tooltip at a time, closed on leave and when the map moves. Double click on a place emits `place:dblclick` once, cancels the map zoom and no `place:click`; a single click waits 300 ms first. Places closer than 50 px form a round bubble with the count (clusters up to zoom 11; `ahm-clusters`, `ahm-cluster-count`); a bubble click or double click zooms to where it splits. The selected place is kept out of the clustered source.
- **Why:** clearer, better-looking markers (task 008 points 4-7, 21 and 5).
- **Files:** `app/js/map/map.js`, `changes/map.md`. Tests: `tests/js/map.test.js` (written by map-tdd).
- **No interface change:** no new `AHM.map` command, no new event. `place:click` and `place:dblclick` keep their payload.
- **How to verify:** `node tests/js/run.js --no-browser`. By hand: select a place (its symbol grows with a white outline, no orange ring); hover a place (it lightens, tooltip above it); double click a place (sidebar opens its focus, map does not zoom twice); zoom out on a dense area (round bubbles with counts); click a bubble (map zooms to where it splits).
- **Follow-ups:** `todo/map.md` not ticked in this change; the sidebar half of double click is task 012.

## 2026-11-12 — Place types are a dictionary (T-025, I-8)

- **What:** `AHM.map.setTypes(types)` rebuilds `TYPE_STYLE` from the dictionary and redraws; `AHM.map.getSymbols()`; new symbols `pentagon`, `tree`, `sword`, `pickaxe`, `flag`; images of a changed type are replaced; `typeIcon` also accepts a draft `{ symbol, color, size }` (preview).
- **Why:** administrators must be able to add markers (iron mine, cedar forest, sword artefact) without a code change.
- **Files:** `app/js/map/typeicons.js`, `app/js/map/map.js`, `tests/js/map.test.js`
- **How to verify:** `node tests/js/run.js`. By hand: add a type in More → Place types, give it to a place: the marker changes on the map without a reload.
- **Follow-ups:** none.

## 2026-11-14 — Custom symbols for place types (T-025)

- **What:** A type with a custom symbol is drawn from its path (`Path2D`, scaled to the marker size and centred); the same for the editor preview, the list and the hover look. Bad path or box = circle.
- **Why:** the list of 15 symbols is too small (iron mine, cedar forest, sword artefact, ...).
- **Files:** `app/js/map/typeicons.js`, `tests/js/map.test.js`, `tests/js/lint.test.js`, `app/dist/`
- **How to verify:** `node tests/js/run.js`.
- **Follow-ups:** `style.path` and `style.box` are an addition to `interfaces/I-8` (see `TODO.md` T-026).

## 2026-11-14 — More tests for the place types dictionary (T-025)

- **What:** Tests: custom symbol drawn as one scaled and centred `Path2D` (stroke twice, fill once); circle without `Path2D`; no path for a non-custom type; `typeIcon` cache and draft; `registerTypeIcons` replaces existing images; `setTypes` before and after the map is ready; `loadTypes` without a file.
- **Why:** the dictionary and custom symbols had tests for the main paths only; no code changed.
- **Files:** `tests/js/map.test.js`, `tests/js/data.test.js`
- **How to verify:** `node tests/js/run.js`.
- **Follow-ups:** the type editor of the sidebar (`ui.js`) and `dev/save-handler.js` have no new tests: the editor needs a browser run, the dev server was left out on purpose.

One entry per change, newest last: date, what, why, files, how to verify, open follow-ups. Only the map domain appends here (DOMAINS.md, rule 7). The history before 2026-11-06 is in the legacy `AGENT_CHANGES.md` (entries #1-#26), which is now read-only.

## 2026-11-14 — T-021: routes on the map (written afterwards; commits `b0b76d2`, `571630d`, `2f38036`)

- **What:** `app/js/map/shapes.js`: route lines with direction arrows (one-way routes), the path found by Find a path drawn as a bold line over the routes, and the drawing tool for lines `drawShape({ kind: 'line', coords, ids, snap, locate, expand, onNote })`: A and B labels, a click on a place marker makes it a stop, a handle in the middle of each segment inserts a point, undo takes a click and its road away together, optional roads between clicks through `expand`.
- **Why:** the Routes tab draws on the map first (T-021).
- **Files:** `app/js/map/shapes.js`.
- **How to verify:** the map library comes from a CDN, so only by eye: Routes tab, add a route, click place markers and free points, drag a handle, save.
- **Follow-ups:** the map canvas is not covered by any automatic test.
